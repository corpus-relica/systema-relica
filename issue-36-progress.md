## Subtasks

### ✅ #43: Audit and reorganize Dockerfiles to package directories
- All Dockerfiles have been moved to their respective package directories
- Each service has both Dockerfile (for deployment) and Dockerfile.dev (for local development)
- Added DOCKER.md with documentation of the new structure
- COMPLETE

### ✅ #44: Create development-focused docker-compose.dev.yml
- Created docker-compose.dev.yml using localhost networking
- All services use the default bridge network for localhost communication
- Environment variables updated to use localhost instead of container names
- Added dev.sh helper script for easier development workflows
- COMPLETE

### ✅ #45: Update docker-compose.yml for deployment and CI/CD integration
- Updated docker-compose.yml to reference Dockerfiles in their new locations
- All services use deployment-focused Dockerfiles
- Container networking configured for deployment environment
- COMPLETE

### ✅ #46: Create development workflow scripts and documentation
- Added dev.sh for basic service management (start, stop, logs, etc.)
- Created DEVELOPMENT.md with comprehensive workflow documentation
- Included examples for common development scenarios and troubleshooting
- COMPLETE

## Summary

All subtasks for issue #36 have been completed:

1. Dockerfiles have been moved to their respective package directories
2. A development-focused docker-compose.dev.yml has been created
3. The deployment docker-compose.yml has been updated
4. Development workflow scripts and documentation have been provided

The changes make it easier to:
- Develop locally with hot-reloading
- Run services independently
- Switch between development and deployment environments
- Understand the Docker structure and workflow

### Testing

The changes should be tested by:
1. Starting the development environment: `./dev.sh start`
2. Verifying all services can communicate with each other
3. Making changes to code and confirming hot-reloading works
4. Testing the deployment configuration with `docker-compose up`

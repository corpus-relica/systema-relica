# AODF: Clarity Service

## 1. Overview
The Clarity service handles real-time data processing, analysis, and event generation within the Relica system. It consumes data streams and produces insights or triggers actions.

## 2. Structure
- **Core Namespace:** `io.relica.clarity.core`
- **Key Modules:** `io.relica.clarity.processor`, `io.relica.clarity.stream`, `io.relica.clarity.rules`

## 3. Execution Flow
1. Data ingested via input streams (e.g., WebSocket, Kafka).
2. Data processed according to defined rules and models.
3. Results/events emitted to output streams or stored via Archivist.

## 4. Operations
- `process-event`: Handles incoming data events.
- `evaluate-rules`: Applies configured rules to data.
- `publish-result`: Sends processed results downstream.

## 5. Relationships
- **Depends on:** `io.relica.common`, `io.relica.archivist` (optional for state)
- **Used by:** `io.relica.portal` (for real-time updates), other backend systems.

## 6. Environment Variables
- `CLARITY_WS_URL`: WebSocket endpoint for receiving data or control commands.
- `KAFKA_BROKERS`: Kafka broker list for stream processing.
- `CLARITY_PORT`: Service port.

## 7. Deployment
Deployed as a scalable service, often containerized and managed by an orchestrator.

## 8. Troubleshooting
- Verify input stream connections.
- Check logs for processing errors or rule evaluation failures.
- Monitor resource usage (CPU/memory) under load.

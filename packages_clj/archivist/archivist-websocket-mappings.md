## Implementation Notes

1. The new message identifiers follow the pattern `:component.resource/command`
2. Resources have been standardized (e.g., `fact`, `entity`, `specialization`, etc.)
3. Commands are generally verb-noun format, with most read operations using the pattern `noun-get` for consistency
4. Compound commands maintain their descriptive nature but in a more consistent format
5. The component name ('archivist') is now explicitly included in every message identifier

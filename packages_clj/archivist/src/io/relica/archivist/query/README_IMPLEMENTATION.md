# GEL Query Subsystem Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Gellish Expression Language (GEL) query subsystem in Clojure, which was ported from the original TypeScript implementation.

The subsystem provides a comprehensive pipeline for:
1. Parsing GEL queries into structured data
2. Converting the parsed data to Cypher queries
3. Executing the queries against Neo4j
4. Aggregating and formatting the results

## Components

### 1. GEL Parser (`gel_parser.clj`)

The core of the subsystem is a parser that converts GEL query strings to Clojure data structures.

Key features:
- Handles basic facts with UIDs and names
- Supports facts with roles
- Parses metadata annotations
- Processes queries with single and numbered placeholders
- Expands nested structures and multiple placeholder shorthands
- Supports taxonomic queries (lineage and subtype cone)
- Handles quoted strings with special characters

Example:
```clojure
;; Input: "101.Pump A > 1190.has as part > 201.Impeller"
;; Output:
{:type :statement
 :left {:type :regular :uid 101 :name "Pump A"}
 :relation {:type :regular :uid 1190 :name "has as part"}
 :right {:type :regular :uid 201 :name "Impeller"}}
```

### 2. GEL to Cypher Converter (`gel_to_cypher.clj`)

Converts parsed GEL structures into Cypher queries that can be executed against Neo4j.

Key features:
- Generates MATCH patterns for each fact
- Handles variable naming and parameterization
- Supports descendant lookups
- Produces complete Cypher queries

Example:
```clojure
;; Input: "?1 > 5935.is classified as > 40043.pump"
;; Output:
"MATCH (var_1:Entity)--(f0:Fact)--(e40043:Entity)
 WHERE f0.rel_type_uid = 5935 AND e40043.uid = 40043
 RETURN var_1"
```

### 3. Query Execution (`query_execution.clj`)

Executes Cypher queries against Neo4j and extracts the results.

Key features:
- Integrates with Neo4j using neo4j-clj
- Executes dynamic queries
- Extracts variable bindings from results
- Handles asynchronous execution with core.async

Example:
```clojure
;; Input: "?1 > 5935.is classified as > 40043.pump"
;; Output:
[{1 {:uid 101 :name "Pump A"}}
 {1 {:uid 102 :name "Pump B"}}]
```

### 4. Result Aggregation (`result_aggregation.clj`)

Aggregates results from multiple query patterns and formats them consistently.

Key features:
- Joins results on shared variables (Datalog-like)
- Ensures consistent variable bindings
- Formats results for presentation
- Creates tabular output

Example:
```clojure
;; Input results from multiple patterns
;; Output:
{:columns ["?1" "?2"]
 :rows [["101 (Pump A)" "210 (Bearing A)"]]}
```

## Integration Tests

The implementation includes integration tests that verify the complete pipeline:
- Simple single-pattern queries
- Complex multi-pattern queries
- Queries with nested structures
- Handling of metadata
- Taxonomic queries
- Result formatting and aggregation

## Limitations and Future Work

While the current implementation satisfies the requirements, there are areas for improvement:

1. **Performance**: The parser could be optimized for very large GEL expressions
2. **Special Characters**: More robust handling of quoted strings with special characters
3. **Error Reporting**: More detailed error messages for invalid GEL syntax
4. **Formal Grammar**: Integration with Instaparse for a more formal grammar definition
5. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently executed queries

## Usage Example

```clojure
(require '[io.relica.archivist.query.gel-parser :as parser]
         '[io.relica.archivist.query.gel-to-cypher :as g2c]
         '[io.relica.archivist.query.query-execution :as qexec]
         '[io.relica.archivist.query.result-aggregation :as ragg])

;; Connect to Neo4j
(def conn (qexec/connect "bolt://localhost:7687" "neo4j" "password"))

;; Parse and execute a simple query
(def results (qexec/process-gel-query conn "?1 > 5935.is classified as > 40043.pump"))

;; Format the results
(def formatted (ragg/format-results results))

;; Create a result table
(def table (ragg/create-result-table formatted))
```

By following the path laid out in the ticket, we've successfully ported the RGNS query subsystem from TypeScript to Clojure, enhancing it with the newer GEL specification features.
